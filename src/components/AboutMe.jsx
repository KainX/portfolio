        <p> I studied programming in high school and since I wrote my first Hello World program I fell in love with
            this wonderful process. I currently work with a diverse team from differents parts of the world.

            A case of success is when I worked for a startup and was in charge of the development of the main apps
            without prior mobile dev knowledge, these apps were published in the marketplace and available for some time
            before their retirement a few years later.

            I aim to create amazing web apps that are used by millions of people over the world.
